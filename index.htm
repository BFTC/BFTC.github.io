  &nbsp;&nbsp;The first British singles chart was published in the 
  November 14, 1952 edition of the New Musical Express. It was at first 
  little more than a gimmick, a tool in the circulation war against NME's 
  much older (and more popular) rival Melody Maker. The chart, at first a 
  top 12, was the creation of the paper's advertising manager, Percy 
  Dickins, who compiled it by telephoning around 20 major record stores 
  and aggregating their sales reports. He would continue to personally 
  oversee the compilation of the chart well into the 1960s. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The chart rapidly became one of the paper's most popular 
  features. After only a few weeks, it started being quoted in record 
  company advertisements and press releases. The chart also spawned 
  imitators - Record Mirror launched its own chart in 1955 and Melody 
  Maker in 1958. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The forerunner of today's official chart first appeared in 
  the music trade publication Record Retailer (now Music Week) in 1960 as 
  a Top 50, but was not immediately recognised as the definitive chart in 
  the country. Arguably, the NME chart was still the most recognised 
  chart, and had the advantage of widespread exposure due to its use by 
  Radio Luxembourg. Throughout the sixties, the various different charts 
  vied for public recognition, leading to some historical anomalies — for 
  example, The Beatles' second single &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was 
  a number one on most charts, but not in Record Retailer. To add to the 
  confusion, the chart used by the BBC on their popular shows Pick of the 
  Pops and Top Of The Pops was actually calculated by averaging out all 
  the others, and so didn't agree with any of them, and was prone to tied 
  positions. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't until 1969 that a truly reliable, official chart 
  emerged, from an alliance between the BBC and Record Retailer. For the 
  first time a professional polling organisation, BMRB, was commissioned 
  to oversee the chart, and a pool of 500 record shops was used - more 
  than twice as many as had been used for any previous chart. The new 
  Official Top 50 was inaugurated in the week ending 12 February 1969. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1978, the singles chart was extended from a Top 50 to a 
  Top 75. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, BMRB lost their contract to Gallup, who arranged 
  for electronic data gathering to replace the old sales diary method of 
  compilation. The first chart terminals appeared in record shops in 1984. 
  As a result, in October 1987, it was now possible for the chart, 
  incorporating sales up to close of business on Saturday, to be 
  announced on Sunday afternoon, rather than being delayed until Tuesday 
  as was previously the case. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the chart came under the auspices of CIN (Chart 
  Information Network), a syndicate including the BBC, Spotlight 
  (publishers of Music Week), the BPI and BARD (British Association of 
  Record Distributors). This was basically a formalisation of the 
  previously-existing informal arrangement, and did not significantly 
  affect compilation. </font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly 
  popularity of songs or albums in the United States. The results are 
  published in Billboard magazine. The two primary charts - the Hot 100 
  (top 100 singles) and the Top 200 (top 200 albums) factor in airplay, 
  as well as music sales in all relevant formats. Worldwide, Billboard 
  magazine is considered the foremost authority in music charts, and the 
  rankings have gained a following among the general public. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="3">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;On January 4, 1936, Billboard published its first music hit 
  parade. The first Music Popularity Chart was calculated in July, 1940. 
  A variety of song charts followed, which were eventually consolidated 
  into the Hot 100 by mid-1958. </font></p>

  <font size="4" face="Verdana">Methodology of its charts</font></span></h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Billboard utilizes a system called Nielsen 
  SoundScan to track sales of singles, albums, videos and DVDs. 
  Essentially, it's a system that registers sales when products are 
  purchased from SoundScan-enabled stores. Billboard also uses a system 
  called Broadcast Data Systems, or BDS, which they own as a subsidiary, 
  to track radio airplay. Each song has an &quot;acoustic fingerprint&quot; 
  which, when played on a radio station that is contracted to use BDS, 
  is detected. These detections are added up every week among all radio 
  stations to determine airplay points. 
  <a title="Arbitron" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitron">Arbitron</a> 
  statistics are also factored in to give &quot;weight&quot; to airplay 
  based on audience size and time-of-day. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;All of Billboard's charts use this basic formula. What 
  separates the charts is which stations and stores are used – each 
  musical genre having a core audience or retail group. Each genre's 
  department at Billboard is headed up by a chart manager, who makes 
  these determinations. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, a song had to be commercially available as 
  a single to be considered for any of Billboard's charts. At the time, 
  instead of using SoundScan or BDS, Billboard obtained its data from 
  manual reports filled out by radio stations and stores. According to 
  the 50th Anniversary issue of Billboard, prior to the official 
  implementation of Nielsen SoundScan tracking in November 1991, many 
  radio stations and retail stores removed songs from their manual 
  reports after the associated record labels stopped promoting a 
  particular single. Thus songs fell quickly after peaking and had 
  shorter chart lives. In 1990, the country singles chart was the first 
  chart to use SoundScan and BDS. They were followed by the Hot 100 and 
  the R&amp;B chart in 1991. Today, all of Billboard's charts use this 
  technology. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Before September 1995, singles were allowed to chart in the 
  week they first went on sale based on airplay points alone. The policy 
  was changed in September 1995 to only allow a single to debut after a 
  full week of sales on combined sales and airplay points. This allowed 
  several tracks to debut at number one. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1998, the policy was further modified to allow 
  tracks to chart on the basis of airplay alone without a commercial 
  release. This change was made to reflect the changing realities of the 
  music business. Previous to this, several substantial radio and MTV 
  hits had not appeared on the Billboard chart at all, because many 
  major labels chose not to release them as standalone singles, hoping 
  their unavailability would spur greater album sales. Not offering a 
  popular song to the public as a single was unheard of before the 1970s. 
  The genres that suffered most at the time were those that increasingly 
  impacted pop culture, including new genres such as trip hop and grunge. 
  </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in 2005, Billboard changed its methodology to 
  allow paid digital downloads from digital music stores such as iTunes 
  to chart with or without the help of radio airplay. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, Billboard had separate charts for different 
  measures of popularity, including disk jockey playings, juke box song 
  selection, and best selling records in retail stores. There was also a 
  composite standing chart compiled by combining those, which gradually 
  grew to become a top 100, the ancestor of the current Hot 100 chart. 
  The juke box chart ceased publication after the June 17, 1957 issue, 
  the disk jockey chart, after the July 28, 1958 issue, and the best 
  seller chart, after the October 13, 1958 issue. The July 28, 1958 
  issue was also the last issue in which the composite chart was called 
  the Top 100; the following week was the start of the Hot 100 titles. 
  </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Billboard publishes many different charts, with 
  the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 being the most famous. In 2009 Billboard 
  partnered with MetroLyrics to offer top 10 lyrics for each of the 
  charts. </font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of each year, Billboard tallies the results of 
  all of its charts, and the results are published in a year-end issue 
  and heard on year-end editions of its American Top 40 and American 
  Country Countdown radio broadcasts, in addition to being announced in 
  the press. Between 1991 and 2006, the top single/album/artist(s) in 
  each of those charts was/were awarded in the form of the annual 
  Billboard Music Awards, which were annually held in December until the 
  awards went dormant in 2007 (plans for a new version of the awards in 
  2008 fell through, and no awards have been held since 2007). The 
  year-end charts cover a period from the first week of December of the 
  previous year to the last week of November of the respective year. </font></p>
